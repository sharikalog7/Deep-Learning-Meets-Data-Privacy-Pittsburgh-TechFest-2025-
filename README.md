## Pittsburgh TechFest 2025

### Pittsburgh TechFest is a one-day event designed for technologists, developers, and engineers from Southwestern Pennsylvania to convene, explore and elevate. The event will feature keynotes, technical talks, and panel discussions covering a broad range of topics in AI, software development, security, and career growth. The conference aims to provide a platform for learning, networking, and collaboration among professionals.

### What you can expect in programming:
Present Problem – Solution – Impact
Storytelling with Data
Live Demo and Discussion
Engage with Big Ideas
Interactive Demo, Challenge, or Tech Workshop
Unconference – take away the structure and engage in an informal exchange of information and ideas between technologists

## 📚 Deep Learning Meets Data Privacy 

### Description
This is my first talk on a topic I’m truly passionate about — data privacy in AI. In today’s world, AI systems—from healthcare analytics to chatbots—rely on huge amounts of personal data. But how can we use this data responsibly without putting anyone’s privacy at risk?
The answer is Differential Privacy (DP) — a smart way to keep data safe while still learning useful patterns from it. In this beginner-friendly session, we’ll explore:
What Differential Privacy is and the basic idea behind it.
Why it matters for today’s AI, deep learning, and generative models.
How it can be added to everyday data and machine learning workflows.
Where it’s already making an impact — in companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft, and in healthcare and government systems.
I’ll also share a few real examples like Google’s VaultGemma, Apple’s privacy tools, and easy-to-use libraries such as Opacus and PipelineDP that can help you start experimenting.
By the end of this session, you’ll have a simple, clear understanding of how Differential Privacy works — and how it helps us build ethical, privacy-first AI systems that protect people and build trust.
