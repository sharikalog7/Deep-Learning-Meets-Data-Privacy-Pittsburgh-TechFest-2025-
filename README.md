# Differential-Privacy

A comprehensive collection of resources, codebases, and tutorials for learning and applying Differential Privacy (DP) ‚Äî from foundational theory to state-of-the-art implementations in modern machine learning.

## üîç Overview

Differential Privacy (DP) is a mathematical framework for quantifying and limiting privacy risks when analyzing or sharing data. It ensures that the inclusion or exclusion of a single individual's data does not significantly affect the outcome of any analysis ‚Äî typically achieved by introducing carefully calibrated randomness.

‚ú≥Ô∏è Core Concepts

Privacy Budgets (Œµ, Œ¥) ‚Äî quantify privacy loss and guarantee.

Laplace & Gaussian Mechanisms ‚Äî foundational methods for adding noise.

Local vs. Central Differential Privacy ‚Äî trade-offs between client-side and server-side noise addition.

DP-SGD (Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent) ‚Äî the cornerstone of DP deep learning.

Privacy-Utility Trade-offs ‚Äî balancing accuracy with privacy guarantees.
